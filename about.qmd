Hi! I am Martin Frigaard. Welcome to my personal blog where I write about projects I'm currently working on (or topics I'm thinking about).

I currently work as a Posit System Administrator on the CDC's [Enterprise Data, Analytics, and Visualization](https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/data-modernization/technologies/edav.html), a program within the larger [Data Modernization Initiative](https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/data-modernization/index.html). I also develop Shiny applications, R packages, and create training materials and workshops on data management, visualizations, and reproducible research. I have 15+ years of experience with data analysis, statistics, and research. I'm also a fully certified [`tidyverse` trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/).
