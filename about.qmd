Hi! I am Martin Frigaard. This is my personal blog where I write about projects I'm currently working on (or topics I'm thinking about). 

I build Shiny applications and write R packages. I also create training materials and workshops on data management, visualizations, and reproducible research. I have 15 years of experience with data analysis, statistics, and research. I'm also a fully certified [`tidyverse` trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/).

Check out my other website [here.](https://www.martinfrigaard.io/)
