I've been demoing quite a few Python applications with VS Code lately and thought I'd write some notes and observations on the three popular libraries: Dash, Streamlit, and Bokeh.

## Dash

:::

**Overview**: Dash is a library for creating web applications that are especially good for data visualization. It’s developed by Plotly.

**Pros**:

- **Integration**: Works well with Plotly for creating detailed and interactive graphs.

- **Flexibility**: Can handle complex applications with multiple interactive elements.

- **Components**: Has a rich set of UI components like sliders, dropdowns, and more.

**Cons**:

- **Complexity**: Can be more complex to set up and use, especially for beginners.

- **Performance**: Might be slower for very large datasets or highly interactive applications.

## Streamlit

:::


**Overview**: Streamlit is a library that makes it very easy to create web applications for data analysis and visualization. It’s known for its simplicity and ease of use.

**Pros**:

- **Simplicity**: Very easy to use, with a simple and intuitive API.

- **Quick Prototyping**: Excellent for quickly turning Python scripts into interactive web apps.

- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatically updates the app as you make changes to the code.

**Cons**:

- **Limited Customization**: Less flexible compared to Dash for creating complex applications.

- **Performance**: Can struggle with very large datasets or highly interactive elements.

## Bokeh

Bokeh is a library in Python specifically designed for creating interactive and visually appealing graphs and charts.

:::

**Overview**: Bokeh is a library for creating interactive and visually appealing plots and charts.

**Pros**:

- **Visualization Quality**: Produces high-quality, interactive visualizations.

- **Flexibility**: Highly customizable for creating detailed and specific visualizations.

- **Integration**: Can integrate with other web frameworks like Flask or Django.

**Cons**:

- **Complexity**: Can be more complex to learn and use, especially for beginners.

- **Less Focus on Full Applications**: Primarily focused on visualization, not full-fledged web applications.
