I'll cover developing and publishing Python applications using Dash, Streamlit, and Bokeh.\n\n::: \n\n::::\n\n\n\nI've been demoing quite a few Python applications with VS Code lately and thought I'd write some notes and observations on the three popular libraries: Dash, Streamlit, and Bokeh.\n\n## Dash\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![](img/dash.png){width=40%}\n:::\n\n**Overview**: Dash is a library for creating web applications that are especially good for data visualization. It’s developed by Plotly.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- **Integration**: Works well with Plotly for creating detailed and interactive graphs.\n\n- **Flexibility**: Can handle complex applications with multiple interactive elements.\n\n- **Components**: Has a rich set of UI components like sliders, dropdowns, and more.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- **Complexity**: Can be more complex to set up and use, especially for beginners.\n\n- **Performance**: Might be slower for very large datasets or highly interactive applications.\n\n## Streamlit\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![](img/streamlit.png){width=40%}\n:::\n\n\n**Overview**: Streamlit is a library that makes it very easy to create web applications for data analysis and visualization. It’s known for its simplicity and ease of use.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- **Simplicity**: Very easy to use, with a simple and intuitive API.\n\n- **Quick Prototyping**: Excellent for quickly turning Python scripts into interactive web apps.\n\n- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatically updates the app as you make changes to the code.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- **Limited Customization**: Less flexible compared to Dash for creating complex applications.\n\n- **Performance**: Can struggle with very large datasets or highly interactive elements.\n\n## Bokeh\n\nBokeh is a library in Python specifically designed for creating interactive and visually appealing graphs and charts.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![](img/bokeh.png){width=40%}\n:::\n\n**Overview**: Bokeh is a library for creating interactive and visually appealing plots and charts.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- **Visualization Quality**: Produces high-quality, interactive visualizations.\n\n- **Flexibility**: Highly customizable for creating detailed and specific visualizations.\n\n- **Integration**: Can integrate with other web frameworks like Flask or Django.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- **Complexity**: Can be more complex to learn and use, especially for beginners.\n\n- **Less Focus on Full Applications**: Primarily focused on visualization, not full-fledged web applications.\n\n## Shiny (for Python)",
