## Testing shiny applications

These posts focus on testing shiny applications with `testthat`, `shiny::testServer()`, and `shinytest2`: 

-   The first post covers unit testing a set of utility functions ([Github Repo](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/utap))

-   Your shiny app *should* be developed as a package, but this isn't always the case. If you'd like to test your application's code *without* converting it to a package, check out the second post ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/noap) with the code)

-   If you've built your shiny application as a package and it contains modules, the third post covers **testing module server functions** using the examples from the ['Modules' chapter of Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-modules.html). ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/mstsap) with the code)
